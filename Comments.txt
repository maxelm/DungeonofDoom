Ideas
* Event for war cry before combat (virtual?)
* LINQ queries to show categorized backpack
	Possible use of method Count() to show number of identical items
* Research "Reflection" in order to randomize monsters/items based on class hierarchy
* Add spells/magic (classes or delegates?)
* Turn based fighting
* Different combat moves (choices)
* Multiple levels (e.g 2 floors)
* Boss fight
* Extended fight logic (e.g damage calculations, attack, defense, agility, critical hit chance)
	Possible use of static utils class
* Monster/item count - (field variable in game vs. static variable in monster/items)
	Ability to choose how many monsters/items
* Weapon slot
* Win Condition
* Modifier
	Double[level] Modifier; {0,75, 1,0, 1,2} ...
	Int Level = 1; level++;
	index the modifier with the current level for appropriate scaling.
	Possibly based off of level
	# of monsters, monster strength etc.
* Stamina/energy/mana
	Rest/gain/restore
* Different characters
* Durability to items
	Loss when used (fighting)
